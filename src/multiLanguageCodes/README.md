# Multi-Language Code Samples

This directory contains **the same implemented in multiple programming languages**.
It's part of my portfolio, demnstrating both the ability to work with diverse languages and to highlight their syntactic differences.

## Program Description
Each sample performs the following tasks:
1. Prints a message: "This program was written in <language>."
2. Retrieves and displays the current date and time
