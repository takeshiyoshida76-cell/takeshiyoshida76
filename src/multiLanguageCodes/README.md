# Multi-Language Code Samples

This directory contains **the same implemented in multiple programming languages**.
It's part of my portfolio, demnstrating both the ability to work with diverse languages and to highlight their syntactic differences.

---

## Program Description
Each sample performs the following tasks:
1. Prints a message: "This program was written in <language>."
2. Retrieves and displays the current date and time

## Languages and Files
| Language | File Name | Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| COBOL    | `WRTETIME.cob`   | Requires compilation |
| VBScript | `WriteTime.vbs`  | Windows environment |
| C        | `write_time.c` | Requires compilation |
| Java     | `WriteTime.java` | Compile with `javac` |
| Python   | `write_time.py` | Script, run directly |
| Ruby     | `write_time.rb` | Script, run directly |
| JavaScript | `write-time.js`| Run with Node.js |
| Shell    | `write_time.sh`  | Run in Unix shell |
| PowerShell | `write_time.psl` | Script for Windows |
| WindowsBatch | `WRTETIME.bat` | Script for Windows Command Prompt |
| Groovy   | `WriteTime.groovy` | JVM scripting language |
| Go       | `write_time.go`  | Use `go run` |
| Swift    | `WriteTime.swift`| macOS/iOS language |
| Kotlin   | `WriteTime.kt`   | JVM-based |
| TAL      | `WRTETIME.tal`   | NonStop environment, Requires compilation |
| TACL     | `WRTETIME.tacl`  | NonStop environment, Script |

## How to Run

### Python
```bash
python write_time.py
```

### Java
```bash
javac WriteTime.java
java WriteTime.java
```

### Go
```bash
go run WriteTime.go
```

Other languages can be executed in a similar manner according to their respective environments.

## Example Output

(Example: running Python)
```
This program was written in Python.
Current time: 2025-09-07 07:54:30
```

## Purpose

- **Compare languages** by implementing the same logic across different ecosystems
- **Demonstrate versatility** in both modern (Go, Kotln, Swift) and legacy (COBOL, C, TAL) languages
- **Serve as a portfolio piece** to showcase practical, multi-language programming skills
